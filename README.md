# Collector Cards App
Online store application designed with java, javafx, and mysql. Requires users to signup/login to access the store page. Once on the store page, the user can navigate between Football, Baskeball, and Pokemon cards and select cards to order. The user then navigates to the cart where they can clear their selections or proceed to provide delivery details and confirm their order.

To run this application, the database must be intialized in mysql and the eclipse project must reference the mysql connector jar.
